  <h2>1. Getting Started: What Jazz Theory Is Useful For</h2>
  <p>When musicians come to jazz and think that they need to learn a bunch of music theory to improvise,
   it is often under the assumption that jazz is a math equation needing to be solved.Spoiler alert: it’s not.
  Jazz is first and foremost a language.
  Music theory is simply the grammar, sentence structure, and analysis element of understanding jazz language.</p>
  <p>Think about it:
  Before you went to school and started learning the basic theory behind whatever your native language is, you were already speaking.
  Learning the theory only helped you intellectually understand it better, and expand your abilities to express and formulate your own ideas.
  That is what music theory does for us with jazz.</p>
