  <h2>modal changes</h2>

  <p>Let’s start with the white keys on a piano. This is the diatonic scale: 7 pitches separated by a series steps or half steps. If you start and end on C, using just white keys, that’s the Ionian mode. If you start and end on D, it’s Dorian. Continuing up the diatonic scale are Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian. The key signature of each of these is no sharps or flats. If you sharp F, then Ionian will be on G, Dorian on A, etc., and all will have a key signature of 1 #.</p>
<p>Modes are old school. As in pre-Baroque. Music evolved to where everything (that’s hyperbole) was eventually in either Ionian or Dorian, and later Aeolian replaced Dorian. Ionian became major and Aeolian became minor. They’re not exactly the same as modes because minor frequently sharps the sixth or seventh scale degrees, resulting in different scales. The Aeolian mode has the same pitches as the natural minor scale. Ionian has the same pitches as major. When analyzing music, you typically don’t bother with modes unless you have to. Edit: Basically if something other than Ionian or Aeolian pops up.</p>
